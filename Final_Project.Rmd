```{r}
set.seed(123)
```


#Data Frame Creation

#components:

#total_years_experience: Generates 200 random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 20, and rounds them to the nearest whole number. This simulates the total years of experience of 200 individuals.

#skills_count: Randomly samples 200 numbers from 0 to 50 with replacement, representing a count of skills individuals possess.

#career_advance: Randomly generates a binary outcome (0 or 1) for 200 instances with a probability of 0.3 for 0 and 0.7 for 1, then converts these binary outcomes to a factor. This factor represents whether each individual has advanced in their career (1 indicating advancement).


```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  total_years_experience = round(runif(200, min = 0, max = 20)),
  skills_count = sample(0:50, 200, replace = TRUE),
  career_advance = as.factor(sample(0:1, 200, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7)))  # Adjusted probabilities
)
```

# Split into Train/Test
```{r}
index <- sample(1:nrow(data), 0.7 * nrow(data))
train_data <- data[index, ]
test_data <- data[-index, ]
```

#Random Forest Model Training

#randomForest(). This function is from the randomForest package, which implements the Random Forest algorithm for classification and regression tasks.

#career_advance ~ total_years_experience + skills_count. This formula specifies that career_advance is the response variable, and it is predicted based on the predictors total_years_experience and skills_count.

#Data: Specifies the dataset to use for model training, which is the data data frame created earlier.

#Outcomes: The command trains a Random Forest model to predict career advancement based on the total years of experience and the number of skills. The model will build several decision trees from different samples of the data and average their predictions to improve accuracy and control over-fitting.

#This script is a straightforward example of using simulated data to train a machine learning model. It shows how easily complex models can be trained in R and how synthetic data can be used for educational purposes, prototyping, or when actual data may not be available. The Random Forest model created here can then be used to make predictions or to evaluate the importance of each feature in predicting career advancement.

```{r}
# Random Forest
rf_model <- randomForest(career_advance ~ ., data = train_data)
rf_pred <- predict(rf_model, test_data)
rf_acc <- mean(rf_pred == test_data$career_advance)
```

#Logistic Regression: 
#Description:
#glm() is a function in R used to fit generalized linear models.

#family = "binomial" specifies that weâ€™re performing binary classification, which makes it a logistic regression.

#The formula career_advance ~ total_years_experience + skills_count defines the dependent variable (career_advance) and the independent predictors (total_years_experience, skills_count).

#The model estimates the probability of career advancement and returns a logit score (log-odds), which is then transformed into a probability between 0 and 1.

#Outcomes: The model is trained on the training data to predict the likelihood of career advancement.

#A threshold (commonly 0.5) is applied to the predicted probability to determine if the model classifies a case as advancing or not.

#This approach is interpretable and provides insights into how each feature influences the outcome through its coefficients.




```{r}
# Logistic Regression
log_model <- glm(career_advance ~ ., data = train_data, family = "binomial")
log_prob <- predict(log_model, test_data, type = "response")
log_pred <- factor(ifelse(log_prob > 0.5, 1, 0), levels = levels(test_data$career_advance))
log_acc <- mean(log_pred == test_data$career_advance)
```

#SVM
#Description:
#svm() is a function from the e1071 package that fits a Support Vector Machine model.

#The formula career_advance ~ total_years_experience + skills_count specifies the response and predictors.

#kernel = "linear" defines the type of SVM kernel used. You can also experiment with "radial", "polynomial", or "sigmoid" for nonlinear relationships.

#The model attempts to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the two classes (career advancement: 0 or 1) by maximizing the margin between support vectors.

#Outcomes:The model is trained to classify whether a person is likely to advance in their career.

#Predictions are made using the test set, and accuracy is calculated by comparing the predictions with actual labels.

#SVM is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and when the decision boundary is not clearly linear.

```{r}
# SVM
svm_model <- svm(career_advance ~ ., data = train_data, kernel = "linear")
svm_pred <- predict(svm_model, test_data)
svm_acc <- mean(svm_pred == test_data$career_advance)

```

#F1_Score

```{r}
tabPanel("Model Comparison", verbatimTextOutput("modelAccuracy"))
library("MLmetrics")
f1_rf <- F1_Score(y_pred = rf_pred, y_true = test_data$career_advance, positive = "1")
f1_log <- F1_Score(y_pred = log_pred, y_true = test_data$career_advance, positive = "1")
f1_svm <- F1_Score(y_pred = svm_pred, y_true = test_data$career_advance, positive = "1")
f1_rf
f1_log
f1_svm
```

#Output model comparison:

```{r}
# Step 5: Output model comparison
server <- function(input, output) {

  output$modelAccuracy <- renderPrint({
    cat("Model Accuracy Comparison:\n")
    cat("Random Forest:       ", round(rf_acc * 100, 2), "%\n")
    cat("Logistic Regression: ", round(log_acc * 100, 2), "%\n")
    cat("SVM:                 ", round(svm_acc * 100, 2), "%\n")
  })
  
}
```
#Conclusion â€“ Model Comparison

#Logistic Regression and SVM outperformed Random Forest with an accuracy and F1 score of 80%, compared to 73.6% for Random Forest. Given its simplicity and strong performance, Logistic Regression was selected for deployment.

#The shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) function call is used to create and launch a Shiny application in R. This function connects the user interface (UI) and server logic, which are essential components of any Shiny app. Let's break down what each part means and how they work together:

#Components of the shinyApp Function
#ui: This argument specifies the User Interface of your Shiny application. It defines how the app looks and how users interact with it. The UI is created using various Shiny functions that generate HTML content, which can include input widgets (like sliders, text boxes, buttons), output displays (like plots, tables, text), and layout directives (like panels or tabs).

#server: This argument represents the server logic or the backend of the Shiny application. It is a function that takes three parameters: input, output, and optionally session. The server function manages the app's reactivity by reading inputs from the UI, processing that data with R, and then sending the results back to the UI. This can involve calculations, transformations, calling APIs, querying databases, generating plots, and more.

#Explanation of shinyApp(ui, server)
#Integration: The shinyApp function integrates the UI and server components. It ensures that inputs from the UI are appropriately passed to the server, and that outputs from the server are displayed back on the UI.

#Reactivity: One of the core features of Shiny is its reactivity system. Inputs from the UI are monitored by the server, and any changes trigger reactive expressions in the server logic. These changes then update the outputs, which are sent back to the UI to update the display.

#Launching the App: When shinyApp(ui, server) is called, it launches the Shiny application. If this line is run in an R script or directly in an R console, it starts the Shiny server and opens the application in a web browser. Shiny apps can also be hosted on servers (like ShinyApps.io or a Shiny Server) to be accessible over the internet.

#Development and Debugging: During development, shinyApp() is often used to run the application locally for testing and debugging. Developers can see the effects of their code changes in real-time by refreshing the app.

#Narative
